# Introduction

## Kronotop: Consistent at Scale

Kronotop is a distributed, transactional document database designed for horizontal scalability. It provides a robust foundation for applications needing to manage large volumes of documents while ensuring strong consistency guarantees for critical metadata operations. By leveraging [FoundationDB](https://www.foundationdb.org/) as its transactional backend for metadata and indexes, Kronotop delivers [ACID](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#transaction-basics) integrity, offering reliability often sought in demanding environments.

Kronotop features an [MQL-like query language](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/) and uses the [Redis serialization protocol](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/) wire protocol, ensuring broad compatibility with the Redis client ecosystem. It implements core Redis in-memory data structures like Strings and Hashes, alongside its own specialized structures: 

* **ZMap**: an ordered key-value store acting as a RESP proxy for FoundationDB
* **Bucket**: designed for storing JSON-like documents

While document bodies are stored directly on local filesystems, Kronotop uses [BSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON) as the default data format to organize and store within Buckets, with JSON also available.

*Kronotop is built for developers seeking the flexibility of a document model combined with the transactional safety and scalability powered by FoundationDB.*
