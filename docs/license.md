## Why Apache 2.0?

We chose the Apache License 2.0 because it strikes a pragmatic balance between **openness and permissiveness**.  
It is business-friendly and allows Kronotop to be integrated into commercial and closed-source environments without forcing viral licensing requirements.

This aligns with our long-term vision:  

To make Kronotop a widely adopted, **open infrastructure layer** for modern applications — without creating unnecessary legal friction.
